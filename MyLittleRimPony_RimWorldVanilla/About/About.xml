	<description>This version of My Little RimPony is compatible with RimWorld 1.0, but please be aware that a lot of things are different compared to the version compatible with the latest version of the game. Some things may be changed, while other things may have been removed entirely; you can refer to the list below for details.
	
* Removed elite mercenary pawns from NPC faction as they use armour introduced in Royalty.
* Removed references to vegetarian fine/lavish meals, as they were added in Ideology.
* Regular mercenary pawns from the NPC faction will use flak armour, as recon armour was added in the 1.1 patch (Source: RimWorld wiki).
* The Brony Community scenario no longer starts with horses, as they were added in the 1.1 patch (Source: RimWorld wiki).
* Researching the Evil Sisters statues doesn't require techprints, but the research cost has been increased to 8500.
* Scootaloo now increases movement speed by 15% (only because I couldn't think of anything else).
* Nurse Redheart has been removed.
* Sweetie Bot turrets has been removed.
* The Orbital Friendship Cannon has been removed.
